## Developer Guide

### Preparation

Make sure the following software is installed and added to the \$PATH variable:

- A KubeSphere cluster ([Installation](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere#installation))
- Node.js 8+ ([installation with nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage))
- Yarn 1.19.1+

Install yarn with npm:

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

### Expose the KubeSphere gateway service to the host

```sh
kubectl -n kubesphere-system patch svc ks-apigateway --patch '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'
```

Get the service port

```sh
kubectl -n kubesphere-system get svc | grep ks-apigateway
```

### Config gateway server in KubeSphere Console

Add `local_config.yaml` into `server`

local_config.yaml

```yaml
server:
  gatewayServer:
    url: http://gateway_server_ip:port
    wsUrl: ws://gateway_server_ip:port
```

`gateway_server_ip` is the host ip, `port` is the gateway service port
